## Election-Audit Summary: 

In conculsion, I propose the Election Commission continue to use this script for any or future election. You can do so by modifying the script to show which county or counties have lower voter turnout. This may help to  highlight any issues certain counties have with getting voters to the polls.You could also modify the script to show how well each candidate did in each indivdual county. This will show how favorable or unfavorable a particular candidate was in a particular county.
